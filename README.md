# Backend for veraPDF web application

## Build application

**Prerequisites**

JDK 11, Maven, Docker

**Build sources**

You can use your local Maven installation to build project sources:
```
mvn clean install
```

Alternatively you can use a docker maven image.
For that you need first initialize the volume to re-use maven repo between runs:
```
.bin/init.sh
```
After that you can use `.bin/build-all.sh` script to run actual building. 

## Running in Docker

**Run service stack**
```
cd .docker
docker-compose up -d
```

**Available service endpoints**

To check service availability you can request service status endpoints described in [API Reference](https://github.com/veraPDF/verapdf-webapp-server/wiki/API-Reference#status)

**Stop service stack**
```
cd .docker
docker-compose down
```

## Dev environment
When working on new features it is useful to be able to launch individual services in your IDE directly. 
To use your local services you can start the stack with `PROFILE=dev` environment variable:
```
cd .docker
env PROFILE=dev docker-compose up -d
```
This will launch the nginx proxy with alternative configuration pointing to your services instead of those from 
containers.

Config assumes that you launch services on the following ports:

 * file storage service: `8090`
 * jobs service: `8091`

To change Java heap size in worker container change variable `WORKER_JVM_OPTS` in `.docker/.env` file.
